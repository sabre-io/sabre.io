    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2017/development-on-hold/">Development of sabre/dav and related packages are indefinitely on hold</a></h1>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Evert, and for the past 10 years I've probably done
around 90-95% of development for the <a href="https://sabre.io/">sabre/*</a> packages, and took over 
<a href="https://sabre.io/baikal">Baikal</a> development last year.</p>

<p>After this time, it all became a little bit too much for me to maintain
these. I <a href="https://evertpot.com/sabredav-eol/">wrote a blog post</a> about this. This post is a follow-up that I'm
cross-posting on both my own blog and sabre.io.</p>

<p>I want to start with a THANK YOU! So many people have written in with support
and understanding, and told me about how these libraries have helped them out
in the past. It was heartwarming and also bittersweet.</p>

<h2 id="support-for-sabre%2F%2A-and-baikal">Support for sabre/* and Baikal</h2>

<p>I was asked what's going to happen with future support for these projects. If
you read my post, the only answer I can give you is: "I don't know".</p>

<p>I'm no longer doing maintenance aside from an occasional bugfix when I feel
like it, but I'm no longer giving any guarantees. It's really completely up to
you.</p>

<p>If you're a corporation and rely on the sabre/* projects, and you're also willing
to invest in this, <a href="m&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x6d;&#x65;&#x40;&#x65;v&#101;&#114;&#116;&#112;&#111;&#x74;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">drop me a line</a>. If there's a few businesses like yours,
it might just be enough to setup a small foundation and hire a person to
continue working on this and I'm willing to help in setting this up.</p>

<p>So far there's been no serious offers of this sort, so your best bet might be
to understand the sabre/* source (it's not as hard as you think) and treat the
same way as in-house developed code.</p>

<p>A few have offered to just pay me to work on specific things. I appreciate
this, but one-off projects don't make a lot of sense for me and one of my
biggest issues has always been finding time, not money.</p>

<p>For those of you that are developers and interested in taking over maintenance,
I would just want to say: do it! You don't need my permission or blessing.</p>

<p>The packages are on github, you can submit pull requests and there's also lots
of open, unanswered support questions. If over time the quality of your
contributions is high, I'm super open to just hand over control of the 
repositories you're interested in.</p>

<p>Someone also asked "is there going to be a fork?", which I found a hilarious
question to receive because obviously I wouldn't be very interested in this
idea. If you're thinking of forking though, consider the fact that you can also
contribute to the main project and benefit from the positive reputation the
project already has.</p>

<h2 id="some-small-next-steps">Some small next steps</h2>

<p>At this point I shut down the mailing list and the comments section on
sabre.io. Support questions come in through both of these channels, and without
anyone to monitor these, it seems better that they're gone. Go to github, there's
more eyes there.</p>

<p>I'm also turning off github notifications for all of these projects. If you
really need to get a hold of me, email me or mention <code>@evert</code> on github.</p>

<p>Perhaps in time someone else will post
a happy update here announcing a new maintainer and renewed interest.</p>

<p>Until then, I'm sorry I'm letting you down and thanks to the hundreds of people
that have supported me! Keep an eye on <a href="https://evertpot.com/">evertpot.com</a> if you're curious
what I'm up to next!</p>

    <p>We just released sabre/uri 2.1.0 and 1.2.0. This release adds a new pure-php
fallback parser for uris to work around two problems with PHP's <code>parse_url()</code>,
which had trouble with uris that start with a <code>scheme:///</code> (triple-slash) and
relative uri containing an unencoded colon.</p>

<p>2.1.0 and 1.2.0 have an identical API, the only difference is that 2.1.0 uses
strict PHP 7 typehints and 1.2.0 supports older PHP versions.</p>

<p>To upgrade sabre/uri, make sure your <code>composer.json</code> requires "^2.1" for
sabre/uri and run <code>composer update</code>.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2016/sabre-event-5.0.0-release/">sabre/event 5 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/event 5.0.0. This is only a month after the last major
release, but it's for a good reason.</p>

<p>We've made a change in how coroutines work. Co-routines, which are based on
generators were originally introduced in sabre/event for PHP 5.5.</p>

<p>At the time it was not possible for a PHP generator function to return
anything like this:</p>

<pre><code>function foo() {
    yield 1;
    return 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To work with this limitation in coroutines, we treated the last value that
was passed with <code>yield</code> as the "returned value".</p>

<p>Since PHP 7 it is possible to use <code>return</code> and the PHP Generator object has a
<code>getReturn()</code> method to access it.</p>

<p>We missed this in sabre/event 4, but it was quickly pointed out by Felix
Becker.</p>

<p>Using <code>return</code> makes so much sense now we can, it was worth making a BC break
for and releasing sabre/event 5 with the more sane behavior for PHP 7.</p>

<p>So today there's a sabre/event 5, and the only change is that if the previous
example of the generator function is used in the coroutine system, it will now
have <code>2</code> as its result instead of <code>1</code>.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2016/sharing-changes/">Changes to sharing in sabre/dav 3.2</a></h1>
    <p>We are currently working on sabre/dav 3.2. <a href="http://svn.calendarserver.org/repository/calendarserver/CalendarServer/trunk/doc/Extensions/caldav-sharing.txt">A first beta has been released</a>.
This release includes major changes to the sharing system.</p>

<p>If you are a user of sabre/dav and have never done any deep modifications to
the sharing system, this simply means that from that version onward, there's
a new calendar sharing feature.</p>

<p>To take advantage of that feature, you can just upgrade and then turn on the
sharing plugin:</p>

<pre><code>$server-&gt;addPlugin(new Sabre\DAV\Sharing\Plugin());
</code></pre>

<p>And to allow Apple clients and BusyCal to modify the list of who can access
your calendar, add the following second plugin:</p>

<pre><code>$server-&gt;addPlugin(new Sabre\CalDAV\SharingPlugin());
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you're completely new to this, you can stop reading this article right
here. However, if you did stuff with sharing before, read on.</p>

<h2 id="the-old-situation">The old situation</h2>

<p>Preliminary support for sharing was added to sabre/dav in version 1.7, which
was released back in 2012. However, this release only ever shipped with the
interfaces to allow an implementor to write a custom backend for this.</p>

<p>There were only a few people that have actually done that. This guide is for
those people.</p>

<p>The specification we used back then were 2 apple proprietary specifications:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://svn.calendarserver.org/repository/calendarserver/CalendarServer/trunk/doc/Extensions/caldav-sharing.txt">caldav-sharing</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://svn.calendarserver.org/repository/calendarserver/CalendarServer/trunk/doc/Extensions/caldav-notifications.txt">caldav-notifications</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The internal sabre/dav API's match the terminology from those specifications.
The API's allowed someone to write an implementation that allows a user to
invite another user to their calendar. The others get the invitation and can
accept or decline the invite.</p>

<h2 id="new-standardization-effort">New standardization effort</h2>

<p>In 2014 the sabre/dav project and a couple of other vendors started on a new
effort, with the following primary goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Standardize the proprietary spec.</li>
<li>Extend the specification to also allow CardDAV (addressbook) sharing to be
implemented.</li>
</ol>

<p>To do this, we've split the standard into 4 separate specifications:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-webdav-notifications">draft-pot-webdav-notifications</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing">draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-caldav-sharing-00">draft-pot-caldav-sharing</a>.</li>
<li>And a future carddav sharing spec.</li>
</ol>

<p>So in this process we're not only creating a separate CardDAV and CalDAV spec,
but also adding a generic 'WebDAV sharing' spec that can be used by
WebDAV file sharing systems, such as ownCloud.</p>

<p>On a high level the data-model is similar, but almost everywhere new XML
documents have been defined that are more descriptive, more generic or just
better for aesthetic reasons.</p>

<h2 id="the-state-of-sharing-in-sabre%2Fdav-3.2">The state of sharing in sabre/dav 3.2</h2>

<p>The first place where the new specifications will be integrated, is CalDAV.
So 3.2 is also the first place where we actually ship a working implementation.</p>

<p>However, to do this properly, some big changes were made:</p>

<ol>
<li>The internal API is 100% rewritten. All the properties and classes use
terminology matching the <em>new</em> specs and not the old specs.</li>
<li>A lot of the code has been moved from the <code>Sabre\CalDAV</code> to the
<code>Sabre\DAV\Sharing</code> namespace.</li>
</ol>

<p>But, another thing is really important. The new sharing specification allows
two workflows for sharing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sharing with a notification system. In this approach you can invite someone
to a share, and that person then gets an opportunity to accept, decline or
ignore the invite.</li>
<li>Instant sharing. In this workflow you invite someone, and then that person
immediately has access to the share.</li>
</ol>

<p>The old spec only has support for the first model, and this is true as well
for the sabre/dav implementation.</p>

<p>However, in sabre/dav 3.2 we initially only support model #2. So if you
require the notification system, you can't yet do an upgrade.</p>

<p>We think model #1 is probably more appropriate for public consumer systems,
and #2 works better for systems supporting small teams.</p>

<h2 id="getting-support-for-the-old-specifications">Getting support for the old specifications</h2>

<p>One drawback of using the new specs, is that old clients don't yet understand
them. So we've added a plugin to handle this.</p>

<p>If you add the <code>Sabre\CalDAV\SharingPlugin</code> plugin, this plugin supports the
old apple spec and automatically maps all incoming request to the new model.</p>

<p>This plugin can therefore only work if <code>Sabre\DAV\Sharing\Plugin</code> is <em>also</em>
up and running.</p>

<h2 id="the-old-and-the-new-classes">The old and the new classes</h2>

<p>This table gives you an idea of the old classes and interfaces, and which
classes and interfaces you now need to look at for similar functionality.</p>

<h3 id="%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Csharingplugin%60"><code>Sabre\CalDAV\SharingPlugin</code></h3>

<p>This class split in two:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Sabre\DAV\Sharing\Plugin</code></li>
<li><code>Sabre\CalDAV\SharingPlugin</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Cisharablecalendar%60-and-%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Cisharedcalendar"><code>Sabre\CalDAV\ISharableCalendar</code> and `Sabre\CalDAV\ISharedCalendar</h3>

<p>The old sabre/dav had two node types for shared calendars, one for the
original and one for the shared instances.</p>

<p>The new sabre/dav combines this into a single <code>Sabre\DAV\Sharing\ISharedNode</code>.
Which is used for 'all instances'.</p>

<p>However, there is still <code>Sabre\CalDAV\ISharedCalendar</code> which extends both
<code>Sabre\DAV\Sharing\ISharedNode</code> and <code>Sabre\CalDAV\ICalendar</code>.</p>

<h3 id="%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Csharedcalendar%60-and-%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Cshareablecalendar%60"><code>Sabre\CalDAV\SharedCalendar</code> and <code>Sabre\CalDAV\ShareableCalendar</code></h3>

<p>Like the interfaces, the concrete classes also had two distinct nodes. In
the new system, there is just <code>Sabre\CalDAV\SharedCalendar</code>.</p>

<h3 id="%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Cnotifications%60"><code>Sabre\CalDAV\Notifications</code></h3>

<p>This entire namespace must not be used in sabre/dav 3.2. It doesn't work and
it will go away.</p>

<h3 id="%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Cbackend%5Csharingsupport%60"><code>Sabre\CalDAV\Backend\SharingSupport</code></h3>

<p>This interface still exists and still has the same goal, but it went through
a number of structural changes. It also no longer <em>requires</em>
<code>Sabre\CalDAV\Backend\NotificationSupport</code> as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>

<p>The plan is to implement the notifications engine again, but take a different
approach than we originally did in old sabre/dav versions. The new system
should be better separated from CalDAV and support notifications for different
subsystems (CardDAV, CalDAV, etc).</p>

<p>We will also add support for CardDAV (addressbook) sharing soon.</p>

<p>Hopefully these releases will all be rolled out in 3.3 and 3.4 releases.</p>

<p>My advice for people that <em>require</em> the notification subsystem for now is to
stick to 3.1 until we have a complete replacement. Some shifts will likely
happen until we land on a design we're actually happy with.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2016/validation-changes/">Upcoming changes to iCalendar and vCard validation in sabre/dav 3.2.</a></h1>
    <p>We are currently working on sabre/dav 3.2. <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/releases">A first beta has been released</a>.
This release will include some changes to validating iCalendar and vCard.
These changes might impact you if you use the Card- and CalDAV systems, or if
you are a developer for a Cal/CardDAV client.</p>

<p>In the past we've been pretty lenient in terms of what kind of data you can
send the server. Originally the idea for this was to follow Postel's law, e.g.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually believe that Postel's law and following it is <em>not</em> a good idea and
will actually over time cause networks to become less and less compliant.</p>

<p>So starting 3.2 we are dialing up the strictness of the server. The component
inside of sabre/dav responsible for parsing iCalendar and vCard has had a
validation system for a while. sabre/dav now uses that system when you <code>PUT</code>
a new iCalendar object or vCard.</p>

<p>The system is not yet 100% complete, so it will not yet throw errors on every
invalid object, but over time we will make this more strict by adding new
validation rules.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>One of the biggest areas in validation is that we're now checking for
properties that are required, and how many instances of properties may
appear.</p>

<p>For example, in iCalendar the <code>PRODID</code> is <em>required</em> to appear in the
top-level iCalendar object.</p>

<p>In that particular case, the system is actually able to repair the incoming
object. It will simply add a default <code>PRODID</code>.</p>

<p>A request for this might look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>PUT /calendars/user/calendar/new-object.ics
Content-Type: text/calendar

BEGIN:VCALENDAR
BEGIN:VEVENT
UID:foo-bar
DTSTAMP:20160523T181200Z
DTSTART:20160524T090000Z
SUMMARY:Meeting
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>PRODID</code> is missing, sabre/dav will do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>It will automatically add a <code>PRODID</code></li>
<li>It will <strong>no longer</strong> send back an <code>ETag</code> header after the request.</li>
<li>It adds an <code>X-Sabre-Ew-Gross</code> header. This header is an indicator something
was not right in the request, along with a description for a developer what
was wrong with it.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason we're <em>not</em> returning an <code>ETag</code> is because we have to make
modifications to the object. Not returning an <code>ETag</code> pretty much tells the
client: you must do a <code>GET</code> request after your <code>PUT</code> to find out the current
state of the object and the correct <code>ETag</code>. Fortunately, most clients do this
correctly.</p>

<p>It also works well as a small punishment to a client. They are forced to do an
extra HTTP request, so there is an incentive to fix the bug.</p>

<h2 id="when-we-can%27t-do-a-repair">When we can't do a repair</h2>

<p>There are many cases where we can't guess what the developer's intent was. For
example: every <code>VEVENT</code> must have a <code>DTSTART</code>. If it didn't appear, we can't
really just make one up.</p>

<p>For situations like that, we now always emit HTTP error
<code>415 Unsupported Media Type</code>, along with our <code>X-Sabre-Ew-Gross</code> header.</p>

<h2 id="requesting-strict-handling">Requesting strict handling</h2>

<p>There are also cases where a client developer does not want the server to
automatically repair the object, and instead always do a hard failure when
the server deems an object invalid. This might be especially handy during
development.</p>

<p>To tell the server to always do hard failures, you can simply include the
standard <code>Prefer: handling=strict</code> HTTP header in your PUT requests.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-likely-going-to-be-compatibility-problems">There are likely going to be compatibility problems</h2>

<p>Because we are becoming more strict, it is likely that there are CalDAV and
CardDAV clients that stop working, because they were sending us invalid data.</p>

<p>To deal with this, we are doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>We're testing popular clients to see if they have problems.</li>
<li>If we run into those problems, we try to contact the developer of the
client to see if they are able to fix it.</li>
<li>If they are not fixing the problem, or if we determine that there will be
many users stuck on an old version of their client, we will try to see if
we can add an 'automatic repair' rule to the validation system.</li>
</ol>

<p>The automatic repair will account for most, if not all client bugs, but if we
do run into an issue with a client that will not behave correctly if we don't
return an ETag, and the developer is unwilling to fix the problem (or enough
users can't upgrade) we will consider a client-specific workaround, preferably
based on the <code>User-Agent</code>.</p>

<p>However, we can't test every client on the face of the planet. So we're hoping
developers and users of clients will test sabre/dav 3.2 with their software and
report issues they run into.</p>

<p>Because we completely assume that we <em>will</em> run into new compatibility issues,
and we also completely assume that not every client will be tested when the
3.2 release hits the floor, we recommend users of sabre/dav to test
CalDAV/CardDAV clients they support before upgrading, or waiting a few point
releases so the dust can settle.</p>

    <p>We just released sabre/vobject 4.1.0. This release is fully compatible with
the 4.0.x series.</p>

<p>This release adds a <code>Sabre\VObject\PHPUnitAssertions</code> trait that, for now,
contains a <code>assertVObjectEqualsVObject()</code> function. This functions works
similar to PHPUnit's built-in <code>assertXmlStringEqualsXmlString()</code>, and can be
used by implementors to check if two iCalendar objects or vCards are identical
semantically.</p>

<p>It also contains a number of other fixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>When doing recurrence expansion, the first event now also have a
<code>RECURRENCE-ID</code> property.</li>
<li>Fixes a bug in processing iTip REPLYs to recurring events.</li>
<li>Better error messages and improved validation in a number of areas.</li>

    <p>CalDAV/CardDAV sharing is something <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/pull/696">we've worked on</a> for quite some time.
Our goal is to have out of the box CalDAV sharing working in the next sabre/dav
version</p>

<p>It's taking a long time to implement, because we're not just writing the code,
we're also writing the standard.</p>

<p>These are the current drafts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-webdav-notifications">WebDAV notifications</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing">WebDAV resource sharing</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-caldav-sharing">CalDAV sharing</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today I wrote an article on my own blog about how it works and the current
status. <a href="https://evertpot.com/webdav-caldav-carddav-sharing/">Read it here</a>.</p>

<p>We'll be at CalConnect 36 in Hong Kong next month to discuss this more. If
you're in the area and want to discuss calendaring or sabre/dav, drop us a line!</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2016/baikal-0.4.0-release/">Baïkal 0.4.0 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just released Baïkal 0.4.0. This release contains a number of changes that
should improve the system for a number of users. The 0.3.x range of releases
had seen a number of stability problems, due to a relatively big sabre/dav
upgrade.</p>

<p>I'm attributing the issues to growing pains. With the 0.4.0 release we hope
that the most of the common issues are solved. This release contains the
following changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>SQlite users had issues syncing. This was due to a newly added feature
(sync reports). Upgrading to 0.4.0 will repair your database schema and
should make existing setups sync again.</li>
<li>The installation threw an error if you didn't have the Sqlite PDO PHP
extension installed.</li>
<li>We added the "Property storage" plugin. This enables a range of features
for clients, such as availability, default alarms and "me card".</li>
<li>We added the Scheduling plugin, which adds scheduling and free-busy.
Enabling this should also solve a problem with iCal, which behaved badly
without this plugin.</li>
<li>We removed the "admin locking" features. In the past it was possible to
disable the Baïkal admin by removing the <code>ENABLE_ADMIN</code> file from the
<code>Specific/</code> folder. This feature is now no longer supported, and users
should instead use their Webserver configuration to block access to
the admin.</li>
</ul>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2016/baikal-joins-sabre-io/">Baïkal joins sabre.io</a></h1>
    <p><img src="/img/baikal.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; float: right; padding: 10px" /></p>

<p>For a long time Baïkal has been one of the most popular implementations of
sabre/dav. Baïkal fills one of the biggest gaps that out-of-the-box sabre/dav
has: an easy to use installer and admin interface. It's the best choice if
you're looking for a light-weight caldav/carddav server.</p>

<p>However, since a while development for this project has stagnated a little bit.
The last release (0.2.7) was from January 2014. The result of this was that
many users of Baïkal were on an older version of sabre/dav and there were quite
a bit of open support tickets on Github.</p>

<p>A lot of this had to do with the development of Baïkal 2. This version was
going to be a complete rewrite based on Symfony components and React. While
much of the development focus had been on that new version, users of the
existing system did not get all the attention they needed.</p>

<p>So we've had a talk with the lead maintainer for Baïkal (Jérôme Schneider from
<a href="http://netgusto.com/">Netgusto</a>), and proposed to bring Baïkal under the 'sabre.io' umbrella of
projects. What this means in practice is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>We're moving the existing website and documentation over from
baikal-server.com to sabre.io.</li>
<li>We're now helping with support, and closed over a hundred tickets already.</li>
<li>We're taking over maintenance of Baikal 0.x, and today we're releasing 0.3.1.</li>
<li>Eventually we will release a 1.0 version of Baikal, unless Baikal 2 is ready
first.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ba%C3%AFkal-0.3.1">Baïkal 0.3.1</h2>

<p>Baïkal 0.3.1 is now the recommended version of Baïkal. This release fixes the
most reported issues with Baikal, and also:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrades sabre/dav from version 1.8 to 3.1.</li>
<li>Supports PHP 7.</li>
<li>Makes the minimum PHP version 5.5.</li>
<li>Adds support for calendar/addressbook export.</li>
<li>Adds support for WebDAV-Sync.</li>
</ul>

<p>Effective immediately, this is the only supported Baïkal version.</p>

<p>We will also continue to make fixes and improvements in this branch of
development, as they come up.</p>

<p>Downloads are now distributed via <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/Baikal/releases">Github</a>. If you are upgrading from
version 0.2.7, you can find the upgrade instructions <a href="/baikal/upgrade/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="relationship-between-ba%C3%AFkal%2C-ba%C3%AFkal-2-%26-sabre%2Fkatana">Relationship between Baïkal, Baïkal 2 &amp; sabre/katana</h2>

<p>For those following this project, you might also be aware that we've already
had a project with very similar goals on sabre.io called <a href="/katana/">katana</a>.
So with Baïkal, Baïkal 2 and sabre/katana combined, there are effectively
three active projects that all overlap in the use-case they address.</p>

<p>We haven't fully decided yet what route to take with these. Eventually we would
like to end up with a single active project that addresses this main use-case.
So down the road we'll try to find some way to merge these projects and combine
the best parts of all of them. Baïkal 2 in particular has a beautiful
interface, and sabre/katana had strong benefits because its goal was to make it
fully run as a javascript fat client, allowing it to be used for other
sabre/dav implementations such as Owncloud, and even non-sabre/dav
installations.</p>

<p>The biggest factor in development of the katana project is simply lack of
funding, which means that we can't afford to spend time on it to bring it to a
1.0. This is not unlike Baïkal and Baïkal 2, which has for a large part been a
"labor of love" by its author Jérôme Schneider.</p>

<p>So what we at sabre.io and fruux commit to is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continuous maintenance and support for Baikal 0.x.</li>
<li>Eventually release this as Baikal 1.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for sabre/katana and Baïkal 2... It's hard to make promises. They are done
when they are done, and we'll keep a look at for companies interested in
funding or sponsoring development of these. Also, we're looking for more
maintainers / developers for these. If you're interested, drop us a line! Any
level of experience welcome.</p>

    <p>We just released sabre/xml 1.4.0. This release fixes a number of problems
related to serializing value objects, and in particular array properties.</p>

<p>We also introduced a BC break. Value objects with properties that are set
to null or empty arrays are now skipped, as we feel that this is a more
sane default. It could influence your xml output though, so if you use
value objects, keep a close eye on if this affects you.</p>

<p>Update sabre/xml by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/xml

<p>If that didn't update your sabre/xml, make sure you are requiring <code>^1.4.0</code> in
your <code>composer.json</code>.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2016/sabre-vobject-3.4.9-and-3.5.0-release/">sabre/vobject 3.4.9 and 3.5.0 release</a></h1>
    <p>In a reversal of an earlier statement, we're releasing a sabre/vobject 3.x
version with PHP 7 support.</p>

<p>We just release two new versions of the sabre/vobject package; <code>3.4.9</code> and
<code>3.5.0</code>.  <code>3.4.9</code> is identical to <code>3.4.8</code> but now explicitly forbids being
installed on PHP 7, via composer.json.</p>

<p><code>3.5.0</code> introduces two differences:</p>

<ol>
<li>PHP 7 <em>is</em> supported.</li>
<li>Two classes have been renamed. <code>Sabre\VObject\Property\Float</code> is now
<code>Sabre\VObject\Property\FloatValue</code> and <code>Sabre\VObject\Property\Integer</code>
is now called <code>Sabre\VObject\Property\IntegerValue</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For most people the new class names will have 0 effect on your code. Almost
everyone should just be able to upgrade from 3.4.x to 3.5.0 without any
modifications.</p>

<p>The reason we've done this is due to some external pressure of sabre/* users,
who argued that it's not good that there's not a single sabre/vobject or sabre/dav
package that supports <em>both</em> PHP 5.4 and PHP 7. Thankfully this change is small
enough that it's relatively low impact.</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject
</code></pre>

<p>If this didn't upgrade you to 3.5.0, make sure that your composer.json file
has a line that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "^3.5.0"
</code></pre>

<p>Because the difference is so minor, in the future we'll only maintain the 3.5
(and 4.0) branch of vobject, and effectively drop support for 3.4. If this
concerns you, drop me a line as maybe we can help.</p>

<p>The <code>3.4.9</code> tag therefore mainly exist as an indicator to people who have a
composer dependency targeting <code>3.4.*</code> with composer and are attempting to
use PHP7, or people who have a rather complex dependency tree.</p>

    <p>We just released sabre/vobject 4.0.2.</p>

<p>This version fixes a regression introduced in 4.0.0. When parsing objects with
a <code>CHARSET</code> parameter, in documents that do not support <code>CHARSET</code>, which is
everything except vCard 2.1, the parser would throw an error for unrecognized
values.</p>

<p>If you are parsing iCalendar or vCards, upgrading is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject
</code></pre>

<p>If this didn't upgrade you to 4.0.2, make sure that your composer.json file
has a line that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "~4.0.2"
</code></pre>

<p>Full changelog of this release can be found on <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/vobject/blob/4.0.2/CHANGELOG.md">Github</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2016/sabre-dav-3.1-release/">sabre/dav 3.1 released</a></h1>
    <p>We're a bit late to the party, but we finally have a PHP 7 compatible release
for sabre/dav.</p>

<p>The master branch had PHP 7 support for a while. The original plan for 3.1 was
to include CalDAV sharing support, but this has been taking longer than
expected.</p>

<p>The result was that we have not had a stable PHP 7-compatible release. So
instead of waiting until all the 3.1 features were ready, we've figured it's
better to get 3.1 out as soon as possible and move the new features over to
a future 3.2 release. So here it is, 6 months after the last major release!</p>

<p>Aside from PHP 7 support, there's a few other changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The minimum PHP version is now PHP 5.5.</li>
<li>We switched to <a href="/blog/2015/sabre-vobject-4.0-released/">vobject 4</a></li>
<li>We have support for "Calendar availability" in CalDAV. This feature allows
users to specify what their work hours are (using compatible clients). This
information will then be taken into consideration when generating freebusy
responses.</li>
<li>Lots of memory improvements, stability fixes and better exception messaging.</li>
</ul>

<p>Contrary to past 'major' releases, this should be fairly easy for people to
upgrade to. The BC changes will only affect a very small group.</p>

<ul>
<li>For a full list of changes and BC breaks, read <a href="/dav/upgrade/3.0-to-3.1/">the migration document</a>.</li>
<li>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/blob/3.1.0/CHANGELOG.md">Changelog</a> if you need even more detail.</li>
<li>Use composer, or <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/releases">download the zip</a> to get started with this.</li>
</ul>

<p>This release also marks the beginning of the 'life support' period for
sabre/dav 3.0.x. We'll continue to do bugfixes for another 12 months.</p>

<p>Happy new year!</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2015/sabre-xml-1.3-released/">sabre/xml 1.3 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/xml 1.3. This release is a fairly big update from the
1.2 series. It's 100% backwards compatible, but adds a number of exciting
features:</p>

<p>The biggest is support for a new <a href="/xml/valueobjects/">Value Objects</a> feature. This new feature
makes it extremely easy to map between Simple PHP classes and XML elements.</p>

<p>Read more on the <a href="/xml/valueobjects/">documentation</a> page, or check out our
<a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/xml-atom">Atom sample parser</a> for a working example.</p>

<p>In addition to that:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's now possible to specify custom serializers for specific PHP classes.
This would allow you to for instance specify how a PHP <code>DateTime</code> object
might be serialized, or in general separate your serializers from the
classes they are serializing.</li>
<li>Added new deserializer functions for common XML patterns: <code>keyValue</code>,
<code>elements</code>, <code>repeatingElements</code>, <code>valueObject</code>.</li>
<li>It's now possible to tell <code>Sabre\Xml\Service::expect</code> a list of possible
expected XML root elements.</li>
<li>Lots of small bugfixes.</li>
<li>Major documentation updates.</li>
</ul>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2015/sabre-event-3.0-released/">sabre/event 3 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/event 3. This is a new major version, and comes with a
number of new features and also BC breaking changes.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<h3 id="php-version">PHP version</h3>

<p>This package now requires PHP 5.5. The 2.0 version of this package will
continue to be maintained though if you need PHP 5.4 support.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-promises">Changes to Promises</h3>

<p>We've overhauled the promise significantly to closely match the standard
Ecmascript promise as close as possible.</p>

<p>To do this, we added the following functions:</p>

<pre><code>Sabre\Event\Promise\all
Sabre\Event\Promise\race
Sabre\Event\Promise\resolve
Sabre\Event\Promise\reject
</code></pre>

<p>These are now straight up functions, and not static methods on the Promise
object.</p>

<p>The following methods were added:</p>

<pre><code>Sabre\Event\Promise::otherwise
Sabre\Event\Promise::wait
</code></pre>

<p>Wait makes a lot of sense for PHP so it was added as a core feature.</p>

<p>The following methods were deprecated:</p>

<pre><code>Sabre\Event\Promise::all
Sabre\Event\Promise::error
</code></pre>

<p>Both will still work but will be removed in version 4.0.</p>

<p><code>error</code> was renamed to <code>otherwise</code>. In javascript this function is actually
called <code>catch</code>, but we can't use that name in PHP because it's a reserved
keyword. Other projects such as ReactPHP and Guzzle have settled on the name
<code>otherwise</code>, so we're following their example.</p>

<p>Another change is that promise now uses the Event Loop to trigger events. This
means that events are now predictably asynchronously triggered, whereas before
events might have triggered synchronously.</p>

<p>What generally means is that you might need to explicitly call the <code>wait()</code>
function on your promise to wait for it to resolve. Or you can call:</p>

<pre><code>Sabre\Event\Loop\run();
</code></pre>

<p>See the <a href="/event/promise/">Promise documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="coroutines">Coroutines</h3>

<p>We've added support for coroutines using PHP 5.5 generators. For a great
example check out the <a href="/event/coroutines/">documentation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="event-loop">Event loop</h3>

<p>We added an implementation of an Event Loop, also sometimes known as the
reactor pattern. This new system behaves similar to Javascript or
<a href="http://reactphp.org/">ReactPHP</a>'s loop. The event loop can handle 'timed events' a.k.a.
<code>setTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()</code> and support for events on IO streams
strictly using <code>stream_select()</code> as the underlying engine. See the
<a href="/event/loop/">Loop documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2015/sabredav-3-release/">sabre/dav 3.0 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just tagged and zipped the sabre/dav 3.0 release. This is only a year after
the 2.0 release, but 6 years after the 1.0 release.</p>

<p>This means we needed 440% less time to release. If we continue to increase
speed at this rate, it means we should get a 4.0 release in august, and
somewhere in september we will average 1 major release per hour.</p>

<p>Lets hope that's not the case though, because writing these blogposts would get
old rather quickly.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the subject at hand:</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<h3 id="browser-upgrades">Browser upgrades</h3>

<p>The <a href="/dav/browser-plugin/">browser plugin</a> has received a lot of subtle upgrades that should make
it easier to use. We've removed some of the information that was not useful 99%
of the time, and added the ability to create new principals in the browser.</p>

<h3 id="authentication-system-overhaul">Authentication system overhaul</h3>

<p>The authentication system and backends got a new API, which allows for cleaner
implementation in many cases, and also adds the ability to run multiple
authentication backends cooperatively.</p>

<p>This allows the implementor to support HTTP Auth, as well as for example
OAuth2, or any custom schemes.</p>

<h3 id="nearly-all-xml-code-got-rewritten">Nearly all XML code got rewritten</h3>

<p>Back in 2009 I first started experimenting with the idea of replacing all
<a href="https://php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php">DOM</a> code with code with PHP's <a href="https://php.net/manual/en/book.xmlreader.php">XMLReader</a>/<a href="https://php.net/manual/en/book.xmlreader.php">XMLWriter</a>.</p>

<p>Back then these api's were rather unstable and had a big number of problems.
In 2012 I started again, and since then have been working on a separate
sabre/dav branch to implement this.</p>

<p>After many hundreds of commits, it's finally done. The new xml system is based
on a new <a href="/xml/">sabre/xml</a> library and has made the xml code a lot more legible
and in some cases faster.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it will in the future allow us to make further optimizations that
were not possible before, due to the fact that this new system can read and
write XML from and to streams, whereas the DOM had no other option but to keep
objects in memory (which would become in some instances absolutely massive).</p>

<h3 id="%60mkcol%60-can-now-create-new-principals"><code>MKCOL</code> can now create new principals</h3>

<p>If your backend has support for it, new principals can now be programmatically
created.</p>

<h3 id="support-for-a-%22home%22-like-collection">Support for a "home"-like collection</h3>

<p>We added a new collection type that can automatically create a "home"
directory for every principal, protected by ACL rules.</p>

<h3 id="property-storage-can-now-store-any-complex-xml-property">Property storage can now store any complex XML property</h3>

<p>Before, the <a href="/dav/property-storage/">property storage</a> plugin was only able to store simple string
values for custom XML properties. This has now been changed to allow <em>any</em>
complex XML value to be stored, thanks to <a href="/xml/">sabre/xml</a>.</p>

<h3 id="changelog">ChangeLog</h3>

<p>A lot of smaller changes have been made since version 2.1. You can find more
details in the <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/blob/3.0.0/CHANGELOG.md">ChangeLog</a>. Read from 2.2.0-alpha1 onwards, as most changes
have been made in the alpha versions.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>As always, the zip can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/releases">github releases page</a>, but the
recommended installation method is using composer:</p>

<pre><code>composer require sabre/dav ~3.0.0
</code></pre>

<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>

<p>A few backwards compatibility breaks have been made in this release.</p>

<p>If you are running a standard server, it's likely that you only have to run
the database upgrade script, but if you did any sort of customizations,
chances are that you need to make changes in your code to keep stuff running.</p>

<p><strong>Make a backup.</strong> and then head to the <a href="https://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/2.1-to-3.0/">migration instructions</a> for 3.0.</p>

<p>Drop a line on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/sabredav-discuss">mailing list</a> if you run into any issues, or
<a href="/support/">get in touch with us</a> for our commercial support options.</p>

<h2 id="support-status">Support status</h2>

<p>Due to the 3.0 release, 2.1 now enters maintenance mode. This means that
version 2.1 of sabre/dav will be actively maintained for the next 12 months.</p>

<p>More information about previous versions and their support status can be found
on the <a href="/dav/upgrading/">upgrade</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks as always!!!</strong></p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2015/deprecating-packages/">Deprecating sabre/dav 1.8</a></h1>
    <p>Our versioning scheme from sabre/dav dictates that we stop support for a
version of a package, 12 months after the next major version was released.</p>

<p>In ideal circumstances this means you have the full 12 months to do the
upgrade.</p>

<p>Today marks that date for sabre/dav 1.8, as well as sabre/vobject 2.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-means">What this means</h2>

<ul>
<li>We will no longer do new releases for these versions.</li>
<li>We will no longer accept bug reports for these versions. We might make an
exception for serious security issues.</li>
<li>We will no longer provide support information for people running on these
versions.</li>
<li>It also marks the end of the last sabre/dav to support PHP 5.3.</li>
<li>However, we will still offer <a href="https://sabre.io/support/">paid support</a> for these versions, if you
are truly stuck in the past.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-stats">Some stats</h2>

<ul>
<li>sabre/dav 1.8 was first released November 8th, 2012.</li>
<li>The biggest change was the switch to PHP namespaces from the old prefix-format.</li>
<li>There were a total of 12 releases, averaging 0.63 releases per month.</li>

    <p>Dealing with XML is annoying to many, and certainly us. We've tried many
different approaches to make working with XML less frustrating, and we've
finally landed on an approach that we're happy with.</p>

<p>We're launching sabre/xml to the public today. You can find a bit of an
overview on <a href="http://evertpot.com/an-xml-library-you-may-not-hate/">this blog</a>, or you can jump straight in the <a href="/xml/">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>This library is already integrated into the master branch of sabre/dav, which
will be released as 2.2 soon. We rewrote almost all our XML handling code,
and there was quite a bit! The next release has over 10.000 changed lines.</p>

<p>The next major version of sabre/vobject will also depend on it to support
reading and writing xCal and xCard.</p>

    <p>We just released sabre/vobject 3.4.0. This release has a number of
improvements and bugfixes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Recurrence expansion and parsing is now a <em>lot</em> faster on big calendars.
Our test iCalendar file was about 5MB large with an unusual high amount
of recurrence rules. We got about a 1900% increase in speed. Most
real-world calendars will not be as large, but should still benefit from
this quite a bit.</li>
<li>We're now supporting parsing and validating <code>VAVAILABILITY</code> components,
which is a new iCalendar component that may become an internet standard,
but is currently still a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-calendar-availability">draft</a>. In the future we'll also add support
for this in the freebusy generator, which will make it useful for sabre/dav
users.</li>
<li>Updated to the latest timezone information.</li>
<li>Several other bugfixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject

has a line that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "~3.4"

<p>Version 3.4.0 is 100% compatible with vobject 3.3.*</p>

  <p>How do I create private directories on a WebDAV server.</p>

<p>Doing this is not extremely obvious, and there are a few issues that people

<p>We've added a new <a href="/dav/per-user-directories/">tutorial</a> to our website explaining a 'simple way' of doing this,
and also a more advanced way, using WebDAV-ACL.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2014/sabre-dav-2.1-release/">sabre/dav 2.1 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/dav version 2.1. This release comes about 6 months
after the last major release, so that's nicely on track!</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New features</h2>

<h3 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h3>

<p>We finally have support for CalDAV Scheduling (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6638">rfc6638</a>). Adding
scheduling to your server means that you can invite attendees to your events,
and have those invites automatically delivered to other calendars on the
system.</p>

<p>CalDAV clients that support this will be able to show an invitation interface
and allow attendees to accept or decline invitations, and have all of this
processed on the server.</p>

<p>If you're inviting attendees that are not on the server, you can also
optionally set-up an iMip (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6047">rfc6047</a>) plugin. This will allow the
server to send invitation emails on behalf of the user.</p>

<p>For more information, read the <a href="/dav/scheduling/">scheduling</a> documentation.</p>

<h3 id="vcard-4-support">vCard 4 support</h3>

<p>In the past, the CardDAV plugin only supported vCard 3.0, which is the vCard
version that's required for CardDAV and also what most clients use.</p>

<p>Since sabre/dav 2.1, the server also support vCard 4.0 (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350">rfc6350</a>).
vCard 4.0 is a much more modern format, adds a lot of great features, and
doesn't suffer from many of the problems vCard 3.0 had.</p>

<p>Now if a client stores either a vCard 3 or 4, these vCards will be stored
as-is, but if a client requests either a vCard 3 or 4 (using
content-negotiation), we will automatically convert the vcard before sending
it back to the client.</p>

<h3 id="jcard-support">jCard support</h3>

<p>It's now also possible for clients to request jCard (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7095">rfc7095</a>).
jCard is a JSON representation of vCard 4.0.</p>

<p>jCard is much easier to parse than vCard 4.0, so we also highly recommend
client developers to start supporting this.</p>

<h3 id="changelog">ChangeLog</h3>

<p>A lot of smaller changes have been made since version 2.0. You can find more
details in the <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/blob/2.1.0/ChangeLog.md">ChangeLog</a>. Read from 2.1.0-alpha1 onwards, as most changes
have been made in the alpha versions.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>As always, the zip can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/releases">github releases page</a>, but the
recommended installation method is using composer:</p>

<pre><code>composer require sabre/dav ~2.1.0
</code></pre>

<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>

<p>A few backwards compatibility breaks have been made in this release. Overall
they should be pretty minor and easy to deal with.</p>

<p>If you are running a standard server, it's likely that you only have to run
the database upgrade script, but if you did any sort of customizations,
chances are that you need to make changes in your code to keep stuff running.</p>

<p><strong>Make a backup.</strong> and then head to the <a href="https://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/2.0-to-2.1/">migration instructions</a> for 2.1.</p>

<p>Drop a line on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/sabredav-discuss">mailing list</a> if you run into any issues, or
<a href="https://sabre.io/support/">get in touch with us</a> for our commercial support options.</p>

<h2 id="support-status">Support status</h2>

<p>Due to the 2.1 release, 2.0 now enters maintenance mode. This means that
version 2.0 of sabre/dav will be actively maintained for the next 12 months.</p>

<p>More information about previous versions and their support status can be found
on the <a href="https://sabre.io/dav/upgrading/">upgrade</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>

<p>This release adds:</p>

<ol>
<li>Converting <code>ANNIVERSARY</code> to <code>X-ABDATE</code> and <code>X-ANNIVERSARY</code> when converting

    <p>We just released sabre/dav 2.0.5. Upgrading is highly recommended.</p>

<p>This release has an important bugfix. <code>If-Modified-Since</code> was not handled
correctly, as we were not sending back 304 statuses, but 200 instead.</p>

<p>This could lead clients to believe that their local cache was expired and the
new resource being empty, which in turn makes data-loss a possibility.</p>

<p>In addition to that, the zip also ships with <a href="/vobject/">vobject</a> 3.3.3, which solves
a problem a lot of people have been having with timezone-related errors being
spammed to the PHP error log. Note that this is a PHP bug, but we've provided
a workaround.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2014/sabre-http-3.0.0-release/">sabre/http 3.0.0 release</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/http 3.0.0.</p>

<p>We introduced several API breaking changes, so a major version change was
warranted.</p>

<p>In particular, we modified the API to be closer to the draft version of
<a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md">psr/http</a>.</p>

<p>psr/http is an upcoming standard for PHP development that should unify how we
represent HTTP requests and responses in PHP.</p>

<p>There were several good ideas in this spec, in particular how HTTP headers
are treated, especially when there are multiple headers with the same name,
which is something sabre/http dealt poorly with (not at all).</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Switched to a PSR-4 directory structure in <code>lib/</code>. This means all classes
are now in <code>lib/</code> instead of <code>lib/Sabre/HTTP</code>. This should not change a
thing if you use the composer autoloader.</li>
<li><code>::setHeaders()</code> used to delete all previous http headers. This is no longer
the case, new headers will simply be added to the existing ones.</li>
<li>Added <code>::getHeaderAsArray()</code>. This method returns a single http header. If
multiple headers with the same name were specified, each value will be an
item in this array.</li>
<li>If you use <code>::getHeader()</code>, and there were more than 1 http header with that
name, we now concatenate all these headers with a comma (<code>,</code>).</li>
<li><code>::addHeader()</code> is new, and will preserve any existing header with that
name. Instead, a second header will be added with the same name and a new
value.</li>
<li><code>::getHeaders()</code> will now return each header value as an array.</li>
<li>The <code>Client</code> class now only follows redirects to HTTP and HTTPS urls.</li>
<li><code>Util::negotiate</code> is deprecated, use <code>Util::negotiateContentType</code> instead.</li>
<li>The <code>Client</code> class can now follow redirects, even if the <code>open_basedir</code>
setting is turned on.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>

<p>If you are using sabre/http solely through sabredav, don't upgrade yet unless
you are using the latest development version. If you use sabre/http
independently, ensure that the relevant line in your composer.json looks like
this:</p>

<pre><code>"require" : {
    "sabre/http" : "~3.0.0"
}
</code></pre>

<p>And run <code>composer update sabre/http</code> afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="no-full-psr%2Fhttp-compliance">No full psr/http compliance</h2>

<p>I've matched the Request and Response to behave closer to the draft psr-http
draft, <em>but</em> I didn't go all the way!</p>

<p>I strongly disapprove of how message bodies are represented. The PSR
introduces an object to wrap PHP streams, that has severely less features,
and due to its design it's incompatible with regular PHP streams and doesn't
cover all our use cases. All under the pretense that PHP streams are hard to
use.</p>

<p>Unless that's fixed, we'll not be fully supporting the specification, but it's
still a draft, and there's still time.</p>

<p>Further in-depth testing of the <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip</a> subsystem has revealed a <em>lot</em> of

<p>This releases has a number of improvements, namely:</p>

<ol>
<li>PostgresSQL files have been corrected. Note that while we ship postgres

<li>After nodes had been deleted, locks were not automatically removed. This was
problematic, because re-creating a node could cause it to be locked
instantly. This is now fixed.</li>

<p>This release has a few new features, but also changes a few things. For most

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<h3 id="better-rrule-parser">Better RRULE parser</h3>

<p>We now have much better support for <code>RRULE</code>, and especially exceptions to
recurrences. This solved several bugs that have been outstanding for quite
some time.</p>

<p>We now also support <code>RDATE</code>.</p>

<p>One change is that the old <code>Sabre\VObject\RecurrenceIterator</code> is now renamed
to <code>Sabre\VObject\Recur\EventIterator</code>. The old class still exists, but will
be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>Some more info about this feature <a href="/vobject/recurrence/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="itip-support">iTip support</h3>

<p>VObject now supports generating and parsing <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip</a> messages. iTip messages
are a type of iCalendar object that are used for things like invites, replies
and cancellations.</p>

<p>More info about this feature on the <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="switched-to-psr-4">Switched to PSR-4</h3>

<p>The directory structure of the VObject library changed. Everything that was
previously in <code>lib/Sabre/VObject</code> is now moved to <code>lib/</code>.</p>

<p>If you are using composer you don't have to change a thing, but if you
manually wrote an autoloader, you may have to make a change to accommodate for
this.</p>

<p>We also removed <code>lib/Sabre/VObject/includes.php</code>.</p>

    <p>As of right now, sabre/dav 1.7 has reached end of life status.</p>

<p>Version 1.8 has been released in November 2012, so people had 20 months to
upgrade their systems.</p>

<p>We've done one final release (1.7.13), containing a few minor fixes and a newer
version of the sabre/vobject library (if you're using the zip installation).</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/dav by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/dav
</code></pre>

<p>Or download the zip from the <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/releases">releases</a> page.</p>

<p>Full changelog can be found on <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/blob/1.7.13/ChangeLog">Github</a></p>

<h3 id="what-does-this-mean%3F">What does this mean?</h3>

<p>From this point forward, we will no longer accept bug reports for version 1.7.</p>

<p>Also, no future releases will be made.</p>

<p>We <em>may</em> consider certain security bugs, but there are no guarantees.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading-to-1.8">Upgrading to 1.8</h3>

<p>Upgrading to version 1.8 is not difficult. The main change that has been made
between these versions, is that 1.8 makes use of PHP namespaces, where 1.7
uses the classic 'pear-style' prefix notation.</p>

<p>Make sure to check out the <a href="https://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/1.7-to-1.8/">migration instructions</a> for a detailed overview
of the changes.</p>

<p>Keep in mind though that version 2.0 of sabre/dav is also already released. If
you are upgrading, you're highly encouraged to take that additional upgrade
step. Version 2.0 has its own <a href="https://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/1.8-to-2.0/">migration instructions</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2014/sabre-event-2.0/">sabre/event 2.0 release</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/event 2.0.0. This releases adds a few features, and
also slightly alters the API.</p>

<h3 id="new-stuff">New stuff</h3>

<ol>
<li>Support for <a href="/event/promise/">promises</a>.</li>
<li>The event handler is now faster. This is especially noticeable when making a
lot of subscriptions to a single event, and is likely unnoticeable for most.</li>
<li>Added support for something called the 'continue callback' to the
EventEmitter. This makes it possible to implement something similar to
javascript's <code>preventDefault</code>.</li>
<li>When calling removeAllListeners without an argument, all listeners for all
events are removed.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="api-breaks">Api breaks</h3>

<ol>
<li>We switched to PSR-4 for autoloading.</li>
<li>EventEmitter::listeners() no longer returns a manipulatable array of event
listeners by reference. It's not a simple list of callbacks, sorted by
their priority. The original concept was good on paper.</li>
<li>The argument on <code>removeAllListeners</code> is now optional.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upgrade sabre/event by making sure your composer.json references <code>~2.0.0</code>, and
then run:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/event
</code></pre>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2014/jcal-rfc/">jCal released as rfc7265</a></h1>
    <p>The IETF just made <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7265">jCal</a> available as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7265">rfc7265</a></p>

<p>jCal is a format to encode <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545">iCalendar</a>, but instead of using the clumsy, and
old 'mimedir' format, it uses <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> to encode the data.</p>

<p>This is very similar to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7095">jCard</a>, which is the json-encoded version of
vCards.</p>

<p>We're big fans of this new format. It can already be parsed by <a href="/vobject/json/">vobject</a>
and if you're running sabre/dav 2.0, the server can already emit it from REPORT
and GET requests and accept it from PUT requests.</p>

<p>We recommend everyone in the industry to consider generating jCal where they
are generating iCalendar today. It's a lot easier to parse and generate, and
we hope that over time, jCal and jCard replace iCalendar and vCard as the
format of choice.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2014/sabredav-2-release/">sabre/dav 2.0 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/dav 2.0. The last major release (1.8) was in <a href="http://evertpot.com/sabredav-18-released-with-namespaces/">2012</a>,
so it's been a long time coming.</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New features</h2>

<h3 id="new-browser">New browser</h3>

<p><a href="/img/posts/new-browser.png" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;">
    <img src="/img/posts/new-browser.png" alt="new browser!" class="zoomAbleImage" width="300px" style="box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px #000"/>
</a></p>

<p>The browser got a big overhaul. It hadn't changed much since when it was
introduced in 2009, so a visual refresh was long due.</p>

<p>The new browser plugin shows you a lot more information about webdav
properties as well, making it a more useful debugging tool.</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>A lot of focus has gone into performance, specifically in relation to Cal- and
CardDAV. We've been running the bleeding edge sabredav, and we've seen several
major cpu drops as we've kept sabredav up to date.</p>

<p>We've optimized queries, and provided new shortcuts in the system that allowed
backends to do optimizations that were not possible before.</p>

<p>Lastly, we added WebDAV-Sync support.</p>

<h3 id="webdav-sync">WebDAV-Sync</h3>

<p>Support for WebDAV-Sync (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6578">rfc6578</a>) has been added. WebDAV-Sync is used by
an increasing number of popular Cal- and CardDAV clients. It allows clients to
request a list of changes that happened in calendar and/or addressbooks. This
can greatly reduce memory, bandwidth and cpu usage on both client and server,
and is well worth it.</p>

<p>It's available as a plugin and the appropriate interfaces have been added to
add support for WebDAV-Sync to the collections where you want to support it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, both the default Cal- and CardDAV PDO backends have out of the
box support.</p>

<h3 id="new-packages">New packages</h3>

<p>This is the first sabredav release that ships with <a href="/vobject">sabre/vobject</a> 3.0, and
is also the first release that has part of its functionality split out into
two new packages: <a href="/event">sabre/event</a> and <a href="/http">sabre/http</a>.</p>

<h3 id="calendar-subscription-syncing">Calendar subscription syncing</h3>

<p>There's a proprietary protocol that allows calendar clients to sync
subscriptions with a server. Support for this has been added to the CalDAV
plugin, and is also available in the default PDO backend.</p>

<p>This protocol is at least supported by <a href="http://www.busymac.com/busycal/">BusyCal</a> and Apple's iOS and OS X
clients.</p>

<h3 id="jcal-support">jCal support</h3>

<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jcardcal-jcal-10">jCal</a> is an upcoming standard for representing iCalendar objects in json.
sabre/dav now live converts back and forward between iCalendar and jCal, and
can return jCal everywhere it returns iCalendar.</p>

<p>We highly recommend using jCal over iCalendar. It's a much better format,
easier to parse, and likely to use less memory and cpu while parsing.</p>

<h3 id="new-property-system">New property system</h3>

<p>A big part of DAV protocols is related to storing and retrieving properties
on resources such as files and calendars.</p>

<p>The property system got a complete overhaul for this release. This allowed
for a great reduction in property-related code and allows for a new feature:
<a href="/dav/properties">storage of arbitrary properties</a>.</p>

<h3 id="php-5.4">PHP 5.4</h3>

<p>The minimum php version of sabre/dav has been increased to PHP 5.4. This was
needed for a number of reasons, such as better closure support and traits.</p>

<h3 id="and...">And...</h3>

<p>The list of changes is rather massive. Read up on them in the <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/blob/master/ChangeLog.md">ChangeLog</a>
from <code>1.9.0alpha1</code> onwards.</p>

<p>Also, this includes all the <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/vobject/blob/master/ChangeLog.md">changes from sabre/vobject</a> from 3.0.0 onwards,
<a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/http/blob/master/ChangeLog">changes from sabre/http</a> from 2.0.0 onwards and everything from
sabre/event.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>As always, the zip can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/releases/">github releases page</a>, but the
recommended installation method is using composer:</p>

<pre><code>composer install sabre/dav ~2.0.0
</code></pre>

<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>

<p>A lot of things have changed in this release. If you are running a standard
server, it's likely that you only have to run the database upgrade script,
but if you did any sort of customizations, chances are that you need to make
changes in your code to keep stuff running.</p>

<p><strong>Make a backup.</strong> and then head to the <a href="/dav/upgrade/1.8-to-2.0/">migration instructions</a> for 2.0.</p>

<p>Drop a line on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/sabredav-discuss">mailing list</a> if you run into any issues at all.</p>

<h2 id="support-status">Support status</h2>

<p>As of right now version <strong>1.7</strong> is no longer supported. <strong>1.8</strong> will be
supported for an entire year, until May 2015.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>

<p>This was literally the largest release we've ever done, seeing the biggest
diff, most new features, most contributors and longest development time.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for hanging in there and all your contributions.</p>

<p>I want to specifically thank <a href="https://github.com/staabm">Markus Staab</a> for tirelessly reviewing every
incoming commit, and <a href="https://twitter.com/DominikTo">Dominik Tobschall</a> for all the moral support.</p>

<p>Evert.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2014/sabredav-1.8.10/">sabre/dav 1.7.12 and 1.8.10 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/dav 1.7.12 and 1.8.10. These two releases are mainly
bugfix releases centering around two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better support for If-Match and If-None-Match</li>
<li>Lots of updates in the <a href="/dav/http-patch">PATCH method</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="patch-problems">Patch problems</h2>

<p>We've gotten reports that there were problems with the PATCH plugin, and
the <a href="/dav/http-patch">associated documentation</a>. Things were inconsistent and plain
incorrect at times.</p>

<p>We've extended the documentation a great deal, now allowing you to correctly
use negative offsets for patching and also appending.</p>

<p>We've also added a new interface to enable this functionality, namely
<code>Sabre\DAV\PartialUpdate\IPatchSupport</code>.</p>

<p>The existing interface <code>Sabre\DAV\PartialUpdate\IFile</code> is now deprecated and
will be removed in a future major version of sabre/dav. This was unfortunately
needed to fix what was considered a bit of a mess.</p>

<h2 id="vobject">VObject</h2>

<p>sabre/vobject in the zip package is now upgraded to 2.1.4, which works around
a backwards compatible break that was introduced in PHP 5.5.10 in relation to
timezones.</p>

<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>

<p>To upgrade with composer, just run <code>composer update sabre/dav</code> on the command-
line.</p>

<p>The zip files can be found on <a href="https://github.com/sabre-io/dav/releases">github</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2014/vobject-3.2/">sabre/vobject 3.2 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/vobject 3.2.0. This release is backwards compatible
with the 3.1.* series.</p>

<p>New features:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are now fully <a href="https://hhvm.com/">hhvm</a> compatible. If you're running a recent hhvm
version, everything should work as expected. From this point forward, we
will also actively support hhvm.</li>
<li>The validator now understands a lot more validation rules. So using it now,
either with the API, or on the command-line, should yield a lot more
information.</li>
<li>Support for a range of new timezone identifiers.</li>
<li>Support for additional vcard properties from <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6715">rfc6715</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6474.">rfc6474</a>.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a> utility, for easily generating unique strings for use in
<code>UID</code> properties.</li>
<li>Support for <code>BYMONTH</code> on <code>DAILY</code> recurrences.</li>
<li>Automatically fix broken vcards from Google's CardDAV server.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you like it! To upgrade with composer, make sure that your
<code>composer.json</code> has a line that says:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "~3.2"
</code></pre>

<p>And then run:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject
</code></pre>

    <h1><a href="https://sabre.io/blog/2014/new-website/">New website launched!</a></h1>
    <p>You're looking at the brand-new website for sabre/dav. Up until now sabre/dav
never had a proper website, and we've always just hosted from Google Code.</p>

<p>As Google slowly started to lose interested in code hosting, we migrated more
and more features to GitHub. The biggest thing left: the wiki. So what once
started as a place to host the new wiki, turned into a brand-new design, by
<a href="https://fruux.com/">our</a> very own Martin Kaniut, who's also responsible for the <a href="https://fruux.com/">fruux</a>
design.</p>

<p>We hope you like it, but since it's such a step up from Google Code, we're
confident you probably will ;). If you're running into any bugs, definitely
<a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre.io/issues">let us know</a>. Want to contribute to the wiki? The entire site is open source, so
<a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre.io/tree/master/source">take a look</a> at some of the existing pages and get cracking!</p>
