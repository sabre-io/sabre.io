        <h1>Changes to sharing in sabre/dav 3.2</h1>
        <div>
            <p>We are currently working on sabre/dav 3.2. <a href="http://svn.calendarserver.org/repository/calendarserver/CalendarServer/trunk/doc/Extensions/caldav-sharing.txt">A first beta has been released</a>.
This release includes major changes to the sharing system.</p>

<p>If you are a user of sabre/dav and have never done any deep modifications to
the sharing system, this simply means that from that version onward, there's
a new calendar sharing feature.</p>

<p>To take advantage of that feature, you can just upgrade and then turn on the
sharing plugin:</p>

<pre><code>$server-&gt;addPlugin(new Sabre\DAV\Sharing\Plugin());
</code></pre>

<p>And to allow Apple clients and BusyCal to modify the list of who can access
your calendar, add the following second plugin:</p>

<pre><code>$server-&gt;addPlugin(new Sabre\CalDAV\SharingPlugin());
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you're completely new to this, you can stop reading this article right
here. However, if you did stuff with sharing before, read on.</p>

<h2 id="the-old-situation">The old situation</h2>

<p>Preliminary support for sharing was added to sabre/dav in version 1.7, which
was released back in 2012. However, this release only ever shipped with the
interfaces to allow an implementor to write a custom backend for this.</p>

<p>There were only a few people that have actually done that. This guide is for
those people.</p>

<p>The specification we used back then were 2 apple proprietary specifications:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://svn.calendarserver.org/repository/calendarserver/CalendarServer/trunk/doc/Extensions/caldav-sharing.txt">caldav-sharing</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://svn.calendarserver.org/repository/calendarserver/CalendarServer/trunk/doc/Extensions/caldav-notifications.txt">caldav-notifications</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The internal sabre/dav API's match the terminology from those specifications.
The API's allowed someone to write an implementation that allows a user to
invite another user to their calendar. The others get the invitation and can
accept or decline the invite.</p>

<h2 id="new-standardization-effort">New standardization effort</h2>

<p>In 2014 the sabre/dav project and a couple of other vendors started on a new
effort, with the following primary goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Standardize the proprietary spec.</li>
<li>Extend the specification to also allow CardDAV (addressbook) sharing to be
implemented.</li>
</ol>

<p>To do this, we've split the standard into 4 separate specifications:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-webdav-notifications">draft-pot-webdav-notifications</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing">draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-caldav-sharing-00">draft-pot-caldav-sharing</a>.</li>
<li>And a future carddav sharing spec.</li>
</ol>

<p>So in this process we're not only creating a separate CardDAV and CalDAV spec,
but also adding a generic 'WebDAV sharing' spec that can be used by
WebDAV file sharing systems, such as ownCloud.</p>

<p>On a high level the data-model is similar, but almost everywhere new XML
documents have been defined that are more descriptive, more generic or just
better for aesthetic reasons.</p>

<h2 id="the-state-of-sharing-in-sabre%2Fdav-3.2">The state of sharing in sabre/dav 3.2</h2>

<p>The first place where the new specifications will be integrated, is CalDAV.
So 3.2 is also the first place where we actually ship a working implementation.</p>

<p>However, to do this properly, some big changes were made:</p>

<ol>
<li>The internal API is 100% rewritten. All the properties and classes use
terminology matching the <em>new</em> specs and not the old specs.</li>
<li>A lot of the code has been moved from the <code>Sabre\CalDAV</code> to the
<code>Sabre\DAV\Sharing</code> namespace.</li>
</ol>

<p>But, another thing is really important. The new sharing specification allows
two workflows for sharing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sharing with a notification system. In this approach you can invite someone
to a share, and that person then gets an opportunity to accept, decline or
ignore the invite.</li>
<li>Instant sharing. In this workflow you invite someone, and then that person
immediately has access to the share.</li>
</ol>

<p>The old spec only has support for the first model, and this is true as well
for the sabre/dav implementation.</p>

<p>However, in sabre/dav 3.2 we initially only support model #2. So if you
require the notification system, you can't yet do an upgrade.</p>

<p>We think model #1 is probably more appropriate for public consumer systems,
and #2 works better for systems supporting small teams.</p>

<h2 id="getting-support-for-the-old-specifications">Getting support for the old specifications</h2>

<p>One drawback of using the new specs, is that old clients don't yet understand
them. So we've added a plugin to handle this.</p>

<p>If you add the <code>Sabre\CalDAV\SharingPlugin</code> plugin, this plugin supports the
old apple spec and automatically maps all incoming request to the new model.</p>

<p>This plugin can therefore only work if <code>Sabre\DAV\Sharing\Plugin</code> is <em>also</em>
up and running.</p>

<h2 id="the-old-and-the-new-classes">The old and the new classes</h2>

<p>This table gives you an idea of the old classes and interfaces, and which
classes and interfaces you now need to look at for similar functionality.</p>

<h3 id="%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Csharingplugin%60"><code>Sabre\CalDAV\SharingPlugin</code></h3>

<p>This class split in two:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Sabre\DAV\Sharing\Plugin</code></li>
<li><code>Sabre\CalDAV\SharingPlugin</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Cisharablecalendar%60-and-%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Cisharedcalendar"><code>Sabre\CalDAV\ISharableCalendar</code> and `Sabre\CalDAV\ISharedCalendar</h3>

<p>The old sabre/dav had two node types for shared calendars, one for the
original and one for the shared instances.</p>

<p>The new sabre/dav combines this into a single <code>Sabre\DAV\Sharing\ISharedNode</code>.
Which is used for 'all instances'.</p>

<p>However, there is still <code>Sabre\CalDAV\ISharedCalendar</code> which extends both
<code>Sabre\DAV\Sharing\ISharedNode</code> and <code>Sabre\CalDAV\ICalendar</code>.</p>

<h3 id="%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Csharedcalendar%60-and-%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Cshareablecalendar%60"><code>Sabre\CalDAV\SharedCalendar</code> and <code>Sabre\CalDAV\ShareableCalendar</code></h3>

<p>Like the interfaces, the concrete classes also had two distinct nodes. In
the new system, there is just <code>Sabre\CalDAV\SharedCalendar</code>.</p>

<h3 id="%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Cnotifications%60"><code>Sabre\CalDAV\Notifications</code></h3>

<p>This entire namespace must not be used in sabre/dav 3.2. It doesn't work and
it will go away.</p>

<h3 id="%60sabre%5Ccaldav%5Cbackend%5Csharingsupport%60"><code>Sabre\CalDAV\Backend\SharingSupport</code></h3>

<p>This interface still exists and still has the same goal, but it went through
a number of structural changes. It also no longer <em>requires</em>
<code>Sabre\CalDAV\Backend\NotificationSupport</code> as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>

<p>The plan is to implement the notifications engine again, but take a different
approach than we originally did in old sabre/dav versions. The new system
should be better separated from CalDAV and support notifications for different
subsystems (CardDAV, CalDAV, etc).</p>

<p>We will also add support for CardDAV (addressbook) sharing soon.</p>

<p>Hopefully these releases will all be rolled out in 3.3 and 3.4 releases.</p>

<p>My advice for people that <em>require</em> the notification subsystem for now is to
stick to 3.1 until we have a complete replacement. Some shifts will likely
happen until we land on a design we're actually happy with.</p>
