We just released sabre/xml 1.0.0

This version is identical to the earlier released 0.4.3. We figured it was
good enough to be released as a true stable release, and the
soon-to-be-released sabre/dav requires stable depdencies.

Upgrade sabre/xml by making sure your `composer.json` has `~1.0` as a version
requirement, and then just run `composer update`.

Full changelog of this release can be found on [Github][1].
