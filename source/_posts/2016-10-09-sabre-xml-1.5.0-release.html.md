We just released sabre/xml 1.5.0. This release puts the minimim PHP version at
PHP 5.5.

This release fixes an infinite loop bug during parsing of some invalid XML
documents, and contains an improvement in how we're dealing with the "context
stack", thanks to the PHP 5.5 `finally` keyword. Upgrading is recommended.

Upgrade sabre/xml by running:

    composer update sabre/xml
