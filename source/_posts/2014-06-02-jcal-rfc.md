The IETF just made [jCal][1] available as [rfc7265][1]

jCal is a format to encode [iCalendar][2], but instead of using the clumsy, and
old 'mimedir' format, it uses [JSON][3] to encode the data.

This is very similar to [jCard][4], which is the json-encoded version of
vCards.

We're big fans of this new format. It can already be parsed by [vobject][5]
and if you're running sabre/dav 2.0, the server can already emit it from REPORT
and GET requests and accept it from PUT requests.

We recommend everyone in the industry to consider generating jCal where they
are generating iCalendar today. It's a lot easier to parse and generate, and
we hope that over time, jCal and jCard replace iCalendar and vCard as the
format of choice.
