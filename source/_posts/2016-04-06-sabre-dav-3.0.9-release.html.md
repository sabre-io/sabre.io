We just released sabre/dav 3.0.9. This release contains the following changes:

* We now require libxml 2.7.0 in composer. We always needed this as a minumum
  version, but this was not correctly marked.
* Fixed an issue in the MySQL table structure for calendars. There was not
  enough space to make a calendar to be able to hold events, todos and
  journals all at once.
* Backported a workaround from 3.1 to make Windows 10 clients work.
* Upgraded sabre/vobject.

Upgrade sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.
