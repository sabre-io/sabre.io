As of right now, sabre/dav 1.7 has reached end of life status.

Version 1.8 has been released in November 2012, so people had 20 months to
upgrade their systems.

We've done one final release (1.7.13), containing a few minor fixes and a newer
version of the sabre/vobject library (if you're using the zip installation).

Upgrade sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]

### What does this mean?

From this point forward, we will no longer accept bug reports for version 1.7.

Also, no future releases will be made.

We _may_ consider certain security bugs, but there are no guarantees.

### Upgrading to 1.8

Upgrading to version 1.8 is not difficult. The main change that has been made
between these versions, is that 1.8 makes use of PHP namespaces, where 1.7
uses the classic 'pear-style' prefix notation.

Make sure to check out the [migration instructions][3] for a detailed overview
of the changes.

Keep in mind though that version 2.0 of sabre/dav is also already released. If
you are upgrading, you're highly encouraged to take that additional upgrade
step. Version 2.0 has its own [migration instructions][4].
