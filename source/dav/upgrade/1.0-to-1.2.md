Upgrading from SabreDAV 1.0 to 1.2
==================================

To keep the SabreDAV simple to use and to extend, I wanted to make a few
changes.

Distribution 
------------

Before SabreDAV was distributed as a single .tgz. This is now a zip file.
The pear installation is separate and comes as 4 separate packages.

1. Sabre
2. Sabre_HTTP
3. Sabre_DAV
4. Sabre_CalDAV

This forces a clearer separation of concerns and allows people to ignore
packages they might not need.

All of these are installable from the PEAR channel. The old package *must be*
uninstalled for installation to succeed. This process goes as follows:

    pear uninstall Sabre_DAV
    # If you hadn't added the new channel:
    pear channel-discover pear.sabredav.org
    pear install Sabre Sabre_HTTP Sabre_DAV Sabre_CalDAV

`Sabre_DAV_Auth_*` Backends structure changed
---------------------------------------------

If you had your own Authentication backend defined, based on
`Sabre_DAV_Auth_Backend_Abstract` you need to change that declaration to 
`Sabre_DAV_Auth_Backend_AbstractDigest`.

The 'Abstract' backend class can be used to create *any* generic authentication
backend, instead of just HTTP Digest. 


In addition, some method signatures were changed:

Old code:

    class MyAuthenticationClass extends Sabre_DAV_Auth_Backend_Abstract {
     
        function getDigestHash($userName) {

            // This function would normally return the digest hash
            // This method is removed in favor of getUserInfo

        }

        function getUsers() {
            
            // Before this method would return a 'userId' per user
            // This should now be the uri.

            // This is still optional to implement.

        }

    }

New code:

    class MyAuthenticationClass extends Sabre_DAV_Auth_Backend_AbstractDigest {
      
        function getUserInfo($realm, $username) {

            // This function returns user information
            // based on the realm and username
            
            // the returned data is an array. The array must contain the
            // following 2 keys:

            // 1. uri This is a path to the user. The path does not have to exist
            //    unless CalDAV or similar standards have to be implemented.
            //    It's a good idea to name it '/principals/username'
            // 2. digestHash This is the digest hash that was used to returned
            //    from the old getDigestHash function.

        }

        function getUsers() {
            
            // Before this method would return a 'userId' per user
            // This should now be the uri.

            // This is still optional to implement.

        }

    }

Sabre_DAV comes with both a `File` and a `PDO` authentication backend, which
can be used as an easy reference.


PermissionDenied exception is now called Forbidden
--------------------------------------------------

Old code:

    throw new Sabre_DAV_Exception_PermissionDenied('Message..');

New code:

    throw new Sabre_DAV_Exception_Forbidden('Message..');

Full backwards compatibility is provided, but 'PermissionDenied' will be
removed at some point in the future.

IDirectory is now called ICollection
------------------------------------

The IDirectory interface has gotten renamed to ICollection. The signature has
not changed.

Old code:

    class MyClass implements Sabre_DAV_IDirectory {
      /* .... */ 
    }

New code:

    class MyClass implements Sabre_DAV_ICollection {
      /* .... */ 
    }


Property updating has changed quite a bit
-----------------------------------------

If you implemented custom properties, and specifically updating custom
properties in your plugins or Nodes, take note.

The old request and response was quite complicated, but this was simplified
quite a bit.

Old code:

    function updateProperties($mutations) {

        // mutations is an array that looked something
        // like this:
        $mutations = array(
            array(Sabre_DAV_Server::PROP_SET, '{http://www.example.org/ns}nodename', 'value'),
            array(Sabre_DAV_Server::PROP_REMOVE, '{http://www.example.org/ns}nodename2'),
        );

        // The returned value contains a list of all the properties again, along
        // with the statuscode for the change.
        return array(
            array('{http://www.example.org/ns}nodename', 201),
            array('{http://www.example.org/ns}nodename2', 200),
        );	
        
    }

New code:

    function updateProperties($mutations) {

        // Mutations is now a simple list. If a value is null
        // it should be removed.
        // It looks kind of like this:
        $mutations = array(
            '{http://www.example.org/ns}nodename'  => 'value',
            '{http://www.example.org/ns}nodename2' => null,
        );

        // The returned value should now simply be 'true' for 
        // success, or false or an exception for failure.
        return true;

        // If you do want to tell the client in detail which mutation
        // caused the request to fail, it is still allowed in this new
        // return structure:

        return array(

            // Permission denied
            403 => array(
                '{http://www.example.org/ns}nodename' => null,
            ),

            424 => array(
                '{http://www.example.org/ns}nodename2' => null,
            ),

        );

        // The values are always null in the previous array. This format
        // was chosen because it has the exact same structure as the result
        // of PROPFIND, which also generates a multi-status response.

    }


Locks_File backend now requires a constructor argument
------------------------------------------------------

The `Sabre_DAV_Locks_Backend_FS` class now requires an argument. The argument
specifies where lock information is stored:

    $backend = Sabre_DAV_Locks_Backend_FS('/path/to/locks/directory');

Before the locks backend would use the same directory PHP uses to store
session files, but this was considered a poor choice. So it seems better to 
make the user choose this one.


XML namespace change
--------------------

All custom SabreDAV properties used to fall under the following namespace:

* http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/NS/sabredav

This has been changed to:

* http://sabredav.org/ns

== "Sabre.autoload.php" and "Sabre.includes.php" ==

The `lib/Sabre.includes.php` file is now deprecated and should no longer be
used.  Because Sabre_DAV is split up over multiple packages, this no longer
makes sense.

In the future this might come back as `lib/Sabre/DAV/includes.php`,
`lib/Sabre/HTTP/includes.php`, etc. 

The autoload file is now moved from:

    lib/Sabre.autoload.php

to:

    lib/Sabre/autoload.php

This makes more sense for packaging. The old one also still works, but will
be removed at one point in the future.
